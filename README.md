# 8-Puzzle Project

## Project Description

This project involves implementing 5 search algorithms to solve a modified 8-puzzle. These algorithms are:

 - Breadth-first Search
 - Depth-first Search
 - Uniform Cost Search
 - Best-first Search
 - A* Search

All the algorithms are compared by metrics such as space, time, depth of the search tree and cost where cost is measured by the value of the tile being moved. 

For the A* Search, two heurstics are used which the user can chose. The number of misplaced tiles on the current board is one of the heurstics while the other heurstic involves the sum of Manhattan distances. 

Additionaly, only 3 boards are used with tiles in various positions. These three boards act as different difficulties for the user to chose when solving the puzzle.
